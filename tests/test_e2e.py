"""Conceptual end-to-end test for the Braiins Pool Home Assistant integration."""

# This file is a conceptual outline and cannot be executed directly
# without a suitable Home Assistant end-to-end testing framework
# and environment setup.

# An actual end-to-end test would typically involve:

# 1. Setting up a Home Assistant test instance:
#    - Using a testing framework that can spin up and control a Home Assistant instance.
#    - This might involve configuring Home Assistant to load the custom component.

# 2. Loading the integration:
#    - The test framework would ensure the custom component is loaded by Home Assistant.

# 3. Configuring the integration via the config flow:
#    - The test would interact with the Home Assistant UI or configuration API to trigger the
#      config flow for the Braiins Pool integration.
#    - Input the required configuration data (e.g., the API key).
#    - Submit the configuration form.

# 4. Waiting for the integration to set up and entities to be created:
#    - The test would wait for Home Assistant to successfully set up the integration based on the
#      provided configuration.
#    - It would then wait for the sensor entities defined by the integration to be created and
#      become available in Home Assistant.

# 5. Verifying the state and attributes of the created sensors:
#    - Access the state and attributes of the created sensor entities using the Home Assistant
#      API provided by the testing framework.
#    - Assert that the sensor states are not 'unknown' or 'unavailable' after the initial update.
#    - Assert that the sensor states and attributes contain expected values (potentially based on
#      mocked API responses or a known test API endpoint).
#    - Verify that the unit of measurement, device class, and state class are correctly applied.

# Example conceptual test structure (using a hypothetical testing framework):

# import pytest
# from homeassistant.core import HomeAssistant
# from homeassistant.config_entries import ConfigEntryState
# from homeassistant.helpers.entity_registry import EntityRegistry

# from custom_components.braiins_pool.const import DOMAIN, CONF_API_KEY

# async def test_setup_and_sensors(hass: HomeAssistant, enable_custom_integrations):
#     """Test setting up the integration and verifying sensors."""
#     # Replace with actual API key retrieval for testing
#     test_api_key = "fake_test_api_key"

#     # Simulate user configuring the integration
#     result = await hass.config_entries.flow.async_init(
#         DOMAIN, context={"source": "user"}
#     )
#     assert result["type"] == "form"
#     assert result["step_id"] == "user"

#     # Submit the form with the API key
#     result = await hass.config_entries.flow.async_configure(
#         result["flow_id"], user_input={CONF_API_KEY: test_api_key}
#     )
#     assert result["type"] == "create_entry"
#     assert result["title"] == "Braiins Pool"
#     assert result["data"] == {CONF_API_KEY: test_api_key}
#     assert result["result"]

#     # Wait for the config entry to be loaded
#     await hass.async_block_till_done()
#     entry = hass.config_entries.async_entries(DOMAIN)[0]
#     assert entry.state == ConfigEntryState.LOADED

#     # Verify that sensors were created
#     entity_registry: EntityRegistry = hass.helpers.entity_registry.async_get(hass)
#     today_reward_entity = entity_registry.async_get("sensor.braiins_pool_today_s_reward")
#     assert today_reward_entity is not None

#     current_balance_entity = entity_registry.async_get("sensor.braiins_pool_current_balance")
#     assert current_balance_entity is not None

#     # Wait for data to update and check sensor states
#     await hass.async_block_till_done()
#     today_reward_state = hass.states.get("sensor.braiins_pool_today_s_reward")
#     assert today_reward_state is not None
#     assert today_reward_state.state not in ["unknown", "unavailable"]
#     # Add assertions about the state value and attributes based on expected data

#     # Clean up the integration
#     assert await hass.config_entries.async_unload(entry.entry_id)
#     await hass.async_block_till_done()
#     assert entry.state == ConfigEntryState.NOT_LOADED
